# Broma
Broma is a C++-like language and parser designed to generate "bindings" for C++ classes and functions in external native binaries.
This language is primarily designed for use in the Geometry Dash modding framework [Sapphire](https://github.com/KWHYTHUB/sapphire),
and most of the language features are tailored for that usecase.
